Console Collector
=================

This is a little java program I put together to help me keep track of my collection of retro game consoles
and video games.  Built completely in Java/Swing using the Eclipse IDE.

Features
=================

* Ability to add and delete both consoles and games
* Save and load capabilities
* Alphabetical sorting algorithm

To-Do List
=================

* Add more data elements to the console/game objects (year produced, developer, publisher, etc.)
* Implement more verbose error reporting

Bugs
=================

* The program reports successful loading/saving even if it wasn't, in fact, successful
